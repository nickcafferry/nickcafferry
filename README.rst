A simple neural network training algorithm for accurate `protein secondary structure <https://proteinstructures.com/Structure/Structure/secondary-sructure.html>`_ prediction (PSSpred) !

PSSpred (`Protein Secondary Structure <https://proteinstructures.com/Structure/Structure/secondary-sructure.html>`_ prediction) is a simple neural network training algorithm for accurate `protein secondary structure <https://proteinstructures.com/Structure/Structure/secondary-sructure.html>`_ prediction. It first collects multiple sequence alignments using `PSI-BLAST <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sss/psiblast/>`_. Amino-acid frequence and log-odds data with `Henikoff weights <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/structural-property-of-proteins>`_ are then used to train secondary structure, separately, based on the Rumelhart error backpropagation method. The final secondary structure prediction result is a combination of 7 neural network predictors from different profile data and parameters. The program is freely downloadable on this page.

We have a community chat at `Gitter <https://gitter.im/PSSpred/community#>`_. Feel free to ask us anything there. We have a very welcoming and helpful community.

The aim of this plant design project is to provide critical insights into and recommendations of the available synthetic routes to styrene along with market, feedstock, economic, and sustainability analyses of the venture. This has culminated in a preliminary overview of the plant design and operation in the area of Ordos, China, produced for our clients at Bentham Corporation.
